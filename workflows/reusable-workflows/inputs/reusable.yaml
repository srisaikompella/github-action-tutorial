# Let's consider a scenario where you are generating some artifacts in the calling workflow and say
# we have to generate pass some inputs to this called workflow. We need to pass the inputs because we don't
# want to hardcode the path and artifact name in the step. if you do so, this would not be reusable.
# Think of this reusable wokflow as function which accepts some params which needs to be passed from the calling workflow.
